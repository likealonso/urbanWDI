## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap,

## Getting started
As a user, you can visit the website and use the search bar and browse for definitons, as well as select a "random" word to view. If you'd like to add a word or provide a new definition of an existing word to the database, however, you must sign up and/or log in. As a registered user, you have an exclusive right to edit and or delete a provided definition. Words (and all of its definitions) can only be removed by the web master.

##Next steps
Adding likes and links to the names of users, providing their contributions to the web app. Better CSS.
